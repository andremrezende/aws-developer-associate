                                                allow the function to access both the RDS resource and the public endpoint? (Select TWO.)

                                                A. Modify the default configuration for the Lambda function to associate it with an Amazon VPC private subnet.<br />
                                                B. Modify the default network access control list to allow outbound traffic.<br />
                                                C. Add a NAT Gateway to the VPC.<br />

                                                E. Add an environmental variable to the Lambda function to allow outbound internet access.

                                                Lambda executes the earlier code. How can the Developer fix this in the LEAST disruptive way?

                                                B. Call the update-function-code API.<br />
                                                C. Remove the earlier .ZIP file first, then add the new .ZIP file.<br />
                                                D. Call the create-alias API.

                                                63. A company is developing an application that will run on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group and can access a database running on Amazon EC2. The application needs to
                                                store secrets required to connect to the database. The application must allow for periodic secret rotation, and there should be no changes to the application when a secret changes. What is the
                                                SAFEST way to meet these requirements?

                                                B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with the SecureString data type to store secrets.<br />
                                                C. Configure the application to store secrets in Amazon S3 object metadata.<br />
                                                D. Hard code the database secrets in the application code itself.

                                                the source code from an Amazon S3 bucket. The Developer manually created a .ZIP file deployment package containing the changes and put the file into the correct location on Amazon S3. When the
                                                function is invoked, the code changes have not been applied. What step is required to update the function with the changes?

                                                B. Update the CloudFormation stack with the correct values for the function code properties S3Bucket, S3Key, or S3ObjectVersion.<br />
                                                C. Ensure that the function source code is base64-encoded before uploading the deployment package to S3.<br />
                                                D. Modify the execution role of the Lambda function to allow S3 access permission to the deployment package .ZIP file.

                                                team is building a Payments service which has its own database; the service needs data that originates in the Accounts database. Both are using Amazon DynamoDB. What approach will result in
                                                the simplest, decoupled, and reliable method to get near-real time updates from the Accounts database?

                                                B. Use Amazon ElastiCache in Payments, with the cache updated by triggers in the Accounts database.<br />
                                                C. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse to deliver all changes from the Accounts database to the Payments database.<br />

                                                118. A company is using AWS CodePipeline to deliver one of its applications. The delivery pipeline is triggered by changes to the master branch of an AWS CodeCommit repository and uses AWS
                                                CodeBuild to implement the test and build stages of the process and AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the application. The pipeline has been operating successfully for several months and there have
                                                been no modifications. Following a recent change to the application’s source code, AWS CodeDeploy has not deployed the updates application as expected. What are the possible causes? (Choose
                                                two.)

                                                A. The change was not made in the master branch of the AWS CodeCommit repository.<br />
                                                B. One of the Amazon EC2 instances in the company’s AWS CodePipeline cluster is inactive.<br />
                                                C. The AWS CodePipeline is incorrectly configured and is not executing AWS CodeDeploy.<br />
                                                D. AWS CodePipeline does not have permissions to access AWS CodeCommit.

                                                between the message arrival in the queue and the dashboard update. What technique provides the shortest delay in updating the dashboard?

                                                B. Reduce the size of the messages by compressing them before sending.<br />
                                                C. Retrieve the messages from the queue using short polling every 10 seconds.<br />
                                                D. Reduce the size of each message payload by sending it in two parts
